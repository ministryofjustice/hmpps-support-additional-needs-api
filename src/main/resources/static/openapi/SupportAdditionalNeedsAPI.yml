        when they complete a prisoner's additional needs plan or their previous Review. IE. completing the plan will create

            For example the person was in education and had a cataract which meant they had a visual support need. 
            The ELSP was created for the person. At some point in the future the cataract was removed and 
            so the plan was updated removing this need education ends for this person. 
            Then the person is enrolled in education once again. After enrolling a new need is identified (say) 
            ADHD then the plan will have a review schedule generated but because the person had already started 
            education the deadline date will be blank and therefore the review is optional and not subject to 
            the KPI requirements.
